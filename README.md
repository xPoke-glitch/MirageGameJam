## The game
Survive this in depth environment for as long as you can!

Search around and you will find useful items like spare weapons to fight off the enemies you will encounter throughout your travels. 

You will find stashed canteens and various consumables to keep you going for longer!!

Find wild animals and take them down for food!! 

Keep your stat bars up so that you don't go crazy!!
